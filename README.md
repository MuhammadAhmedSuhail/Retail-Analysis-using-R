# Retail Analysis using R

## Project Description

This project is based on analyzing the retail dataset generated in Assignment No 3 using R programming language. The main objective of the project is to answer the following questions and provide insights into the purchasing behavior of customers.

## Questions to be answered:
- Does the purchase amount of the customers increase over the period of time?
- Are rich customers more likely to churn compared to poor customers?
- Do churned customers visit the stores occasionally?
- Is the overall spending of churned customers significantly lesser than non-churned customers?
- Can we predict churned customers using a linear model with selected features from the dataset?

## Definitions:
- Frequent customer: A customer who makes purchases regularly, at least once every two weeks.
- Poor customer: A customer who has made purchases worth less than the median purchase amount in the dataset.

## Hypothesis testing assumptions:
- Normality: The data follows a normal distribution.
- Homogeneity of variance: The variance of the data is equal across all groups being compared.
- Independence: The observations are independent of each other.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
You will need to have R installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) here.
</br>
You will also need to have R Studio on your machine. You can download the latest version of [R Studio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) here.

### Installing
Clone this repository onto your local machine.
```
git clone https://github.com/MuhammadAhmedSuhail/Retail-Analysis-using-R.git
```
Run `analysis.r` on RStudio to analyze the data

## Conclusion:
The analysis of the retail dataset using R has provided valuable insights into customer purchasing behavior. The results of the analysis can be used to develop strategies to retain customers and increase sales. The predictive model developed in this project can be used to identify customers who are likely to churn and take proactive measures to retain them.
